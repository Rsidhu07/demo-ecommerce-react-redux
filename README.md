# Getting Started with App
 
 npm install .\
 npm start / yarn start

 # Points which are covered in the project:-

-Develop an E-commerce demo website with Signup, login, product, cart, logout pages.
-The site should be built using ReactJs, React-Router, Redux state management.
-Sign up and login to Auth with the firebase.
-Maintain Session, if the user refreshes the page, the session must be only terminated only when log out is used.
-When a user logs in, He/she can see the products (For a list of products, use this https://fakestoreapi.com/ to get the list)
-User can add/remove products to/from the cart.
-Products added to cart should be stored in redux state and all the products that are added to cart should be listed on opening /cart.
-User A's added product in the cart should not affect user B's cart status and vice versa. 
-Logout when the user wants to logout, cart status must be saved as the user has left it prior to logout. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
